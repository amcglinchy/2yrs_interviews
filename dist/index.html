        Making Sense of <br> Making Parole in <br> New York State
      </h1>

      </h3>
      <p class="intro">
        The New York State Board of Parole holds the unique authority to decide on the release of
         eligible individuals incarcerated under the Department of Corrections and Community 
         Supervision (DOCCS). This independent entity is tasked with making decisions on parole, 
         establishing the terms for parole, and revoking it if those terms are not adhered to.
      </p>
      </div>
    <div>
      <p class="intro">
        According to DOCCS, parole board interviews may include questions about past criminal behavior, records during custody, participation in programs, future aspirations, and plans upon release. It's not specified which answers or plans are most likely to secure parole. 
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        So, what really influences a candidate's chances for parole? Are factors like age, race, the nature of the crime, time served, the facility, and the county of commitment significant in determining the outcomes of parole interviews?
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        With this project, I aim to uncover patterns in parole decisions using publicly available data on incarcerated individuals and their parole interviews from September 2021 to September 2023. This exploration seeks to provide insights into how the Board of Parole operates and what factors may tip the scales in thier decision-making process.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        A key point to note: This analysis is based solely on quantifiable, publicly accessible data. It doesn't include private criminal records, detailed explanations of parole board decisions, or other immeasurable factors like the specifics of the crime, political context, the individual's demeanor during the hearing, their perceived remorse, the robustness of their release plan, or the level of community support or opposition. Therefore, while this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to recognize that it represents only a partial view, limited to the measurable aspects of the parole interview process.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        I've found that there are endless ways to explore, analyze, and visualize this data. This reality is both beautiful and overwhelming.

            <p>
              Up til now, we've seen data to suggest a few things that, albeit interesting, aren't entirely surprising to me (given history of this country).
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we've seen that interviews with black people are more often denied than those of any other race.
              And interveiws with white people are more often granted than those of any other race.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've also seen that parole grants tend to trend upwards with age.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="section12">
            <p>
              Let's look at something I found to be a little more surprising.
            </p>
            <p>
              This density chart represents the estimated density of the data as related to the individual's
              proportion of sentence served at the time of the interview.
            </p>

          </section>
          <section id="section13">
            <p>
              If we are to assume that as one serves more of their sentence (the proportion of their sentence served increases),
              they have a better chance of making parole, we would expect to see a normal distribution as shown with the red line.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="section14">
            <p>
              The distribution seen here suggests that there's a sweet spot for being granted parole at around 25% of max sentence served
              and a spike in denials of those who've served well over half of their maximum sentence.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="section15">
            <p>
              Here you can toggle between time served, age entered and age to see each variable's distribution for both the denied and granted groups.
            </p>
            <button class="button-38" id="time_serv_at_int">TIME SERVED</button>
            <button class="button-38" id="age_entered">AGE ENTERED</button>
            <button class="button-38" id="age">AGE</button>
            <p>
              The similarities between distributions of granted and denied for these variables suggests that they're not determining factors
              in whether someone is granted or denied parole.
            </p>


          </section>
          <section id="section16">
            <p>
              Another variable we've yet to look at is the <b>type of interview</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>INITIAL</b>: initial appearance, PIE hearings (parole immediately eligible), merit time hearings, early conditional parole for deportation hearings, medical hearings, and supplemental merit hearings.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>REAPPEAR</b>: Reappearances - release was previously denied.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>OTHER</b>: Parole violation hearings, hearings held after parole is granted but the parole board receives new information that prompts them to reconsider their decision, hearings held after successful appeal of parole denial.

          <section id="section17">

              Initial and reappear make up around 97% of the total interviews, so let's take a closer look at just these two interview types.
