        Making Sense of <br> Making Parole in <br> New York State
      </h1>

      <p class="intro">
        The New York State Board of Parole holds the unique authority to decide on the release of
         eligible individuals incarcerated under the Department of Corrections and Community 
         Supervision (DOCCS). This independent entity is tasked with making decisions on parole, 
         establishing the terms for parole, and revoking it if those terms are not adhered to.
      </p>
      </div>
    <div>
      <p class="intro">
        According to DOCCS, parole board interviews may include questions about past criminal behavior, records during custody, participation in programs, future aspirations, and plans upon release. It's not specified which answers or plans are most likely to secure parole. 
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        So, what really influences a candidate's chances for parole? Are factors like age, race, the nature of the crime, time served, the facility, and the county of commitment significant in determining the outcomes of parole interviews?
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        With this project, I aim to uncover patterns in parole decisions using publicly available data on incarcerated individuals and their parole interviews from September 2021 to September 2023. This exploration seeks to provide insights into how the Board of Parole operates and what factors may tip the scales in thier decision-making process.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        A key point to note: This analysis is based solely on quantifiable, publicly accessible data. It doesn't include private criminal records, detailed explanations of parole board decisions, or other immeasurable factors like the specifics of the crime, political context, the individual's demeanor during the hearing, their perceived remorse, the robustness of their release plan, or the level of community support or opposition. Therefore, while this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to recognize that it represents only a partial view, limited to the measurable aspects of the parole interview process.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        I've found that there are endless ways to explore, analyze, and visualize this data. This reality is both beautiful and overwhelming.

            Firstly, it appears that parole interviews involving Black individuals are more frequently denied compared to other races, while those involving White individuals are more often granted.

          <section id="conclusion">
            <p>
                This exploration into two years of parole interviews in New York State has revealed several interesting trends. Most obvious is that parole is being denied significantly more often than it is being granted. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Factors such as race, age, and interview type play crucial roles in parole outcomes, with distinct patterns emerging, like the higher denial rates for Black individuals compared to White individuals and the disparities between initial and reappearance interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                The deviation from expected patterns in certain age groups, particularly in the OVER 55 category, underscores the complex nature of these decisions. Our focused analysis on denied reappearance interviews reveals nuances that go beyond initial observations, highlighting the intricate dynamics within the parole system.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is vital to remember that behind each data point are real individuals, each with their own story, hopes, and challenges. This data represents incarcerated people who are directly impacted by the outcomes of these parole decisions. As we analyze and discuss these findings, we must do so with a sense of responsibility and recognition of the profound effects these decisions have on lives and communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this study provides valuable insights, it also illustrates the limitations of relying solely on quantifiable data. The parole decision process is multifaceted and influenced by numerous factors, some of which are beyond the scope of this analysis. This investigation underscores the need for transparency and consistency in parole decisions and opens avenues for further research, particularly into the subjective elements that influence these critical decisions.
