        Making Sense of <br> Making Parole in <br> New York State
      </h1>

        by Alexandra McGlinchy
      </h3>
      <p class="intro">
        As a volunteer with The Parole Preparation Project, I worked with two incarcerated individuals in order to help them prepare for their parole interviews. The first man I worked with was in his early 50’s, the second was turning 70. Both men are Black and had committed similar crimes. The first man was hopeful, getting ready for his first ever parole interview. As luck would have it, the Board of Parole granted him release, making it his last. The second man was less hopeful, as he had been denied over 20 times by the Board. Although that interview was also his last, it didn’t change the fact that this man spent most of his life in prison, a large portion of that due to parole denials. 
      </p>
      </div>
    <div>
      <p class="intro">
        These two men differed in past criminal behavior, records during custody, participation in programs, future aspirations, and plans upon release - all things that the Board of Parole takes into consideration. Both men were also remorseful, thoughtful and full of life.  
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        When these men went for their parole board interviews, were they seen as the thoughtful men I came to know and love? Or were they evaluated solely on the crime that landed them in prison and the perceived risk of letting them out?
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        What really influences a candidate's chances for parole? Are factors like age, race, time served, portion of sentence served and interview type significant in determining the outcomes of parole interviews?
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        With these questions in mind, I set out to uncover patterns in parole decisions using publicly available data on incarcerated individuals and their parole interviews from September 2021 to September 2023. 
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        The result is a data visualization story of my discoveries, highlighting what I found to be most important and intriguing. Through working with this data extensively, I've found that there are endless ways to explore, analyze, and visualize this data. This reality is both beautiful and overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        A key point to note: This analysis is based solely on quantifiable, publicly accessible data. It doesn't include private criminal records, detailed explanations of Board of Parole decisions, or other immeasurable factors like the specifics of the crime, political context, the individual's demeanor during the hearing, their perceived remorse, the robustness of their release plan, or the level of community support or opposition. Therefore, while this analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to recognize that it represents only a partial view, limited to the measurable aspects of the parole interview process.

              Here, I want to specifically point out the <b>55 OVER</b> age group.
              It is the only age group that doesn't follow the expected pattern of decreasing denials and increasing grants with advancing age. This age group is considered to be seniors, whereas in life outside of prison that begins at 65, those who're incarcerated experience accelerated aging.

              So far, the data has shown some trends that, while intriguing, are not entirely unexpected considering the historical context of this country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, it appears that parole interviews involving Black individuals are more frequently denied compared to other races, while those involving White individuals are more often granted.

          </section>
          <section id="section13">
            <p>
              Additionally, the overall likelihood of parole being granted seems to increase with the age of the individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, let's look at something I found to be a little more surprising.

                This chart shows the frequency of parole denials and grants in relation to the portion of the maximum sentence served by individuals at the time of their interview. More simply, it compares how often parole is denied or granted at different stages of maximum sentence completion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, some individuals have served 100% or more of their maximum sentence.

              <p class="small-text">
                Note: Percentage of sentence served at interview was calculated using time served at interview over maximum sentence. To determine a maximum sentence length in years for those with a LIFE sentence, the individual's age was subtracted from the average American adult lifespan of 76 years old.

              The distribution seen here suggests that there's a sweet spot for being granted parole at around 25% of max sentence served
              and a spike in denials of those who've served well over half of their maximum sentence.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the exception of those 55 and older, as age goes up, so does the likelihood of being granted parole.
            </p>
              <p>
                As an individual serves more and more of their sentence, a granted decision is not guaranteed.
