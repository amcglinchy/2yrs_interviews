        Making Sense of <br> Making Parole in <br> New York State
      </h1>
      <h2>
        The New York State Board of Parole is the sole entity with discretionary authority
        to grant release to eligible individuals incarcerated with DOCCS. It is an independent
        body responsible for determining parole, setting parole conditions, and revoking parole
        when conditions have been violated.
      </h2>
      </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        According to DOCCS interviews with the parole board "include answering questions about prior criminal activity, 
        custodial record, program participation, future goals and release plans." <br>
        Nowhere does it say that a certain answer or plan is the best to get you parole. <br>
        What makes someone a better candidate for parole? <br>
        Do factors such as age, race, crime, time served, facility and county of commitment
        play a role in predicting parole interview outcomes?<br>
        With this project, I set out to find trends in parole outcomes using only publicly available
        data about parole interviews between September 2021 to September 2023.

        There are endless ways to explore, analyze and visualize this data.

            <p>
              Up til now, we've seen data to suggest a few things that, albeit interesting, aren't entirely surprising to me (given history of this country).
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we've seen that interviews with black people are more often denied than those of any other race.
              And interveiws with white people are more often granted than those of any other race.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've also seen that parole grants tend to trend upwards with age.
            </p>

          <section id="section12">
            <p>
              Let's look at something I found to be a little more surprising.
            </p>
            <p>
              This density chart represents the estimated density of the data as related to the individual's
              proportion of sentence served at the time of the interview.
            </p>

          </section>
          <section id="section13">
            <p>
              If we are to assume that as one serves more of their sentence (the proportion of their sentence served increases),
              they have a better chance of making parole, we would expect to see a normal distribution as shown with the red line.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="section14">
            <p>
              The distribution seen here suggests that there's a sweet spot for being granted parole at around 25% of max sentence served
              and a spike in denials of those who've served well over half of their maximum sentence.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id ="section15">
            <p>
              Here you can toggle between time served, age entered and age to see each variable's distribution for both the denied and granted groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              The similarities between distributions of granted and denied for these variables suggests that they're not determining factors
              in whether someone is granted or denied parole.
