        Making Sense of <br> Making Parole in <br> New York State
      </h1>
      <h2>
        The New York State Board of Parole is the sole entity with discretionary authority
        to grant release to eligible individuals incarcerated with DOCCS. It is an independent
        body responsible for determining parole, setting parole conditions, and revoking parole
        when conditions have been violated.
      </h2>
      </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        According to DOCCS interviews with the parole board "include answering questions about prior criminal activity, 
        custodial record, program participation, future goals and release plans." <br>
        Nowhere does it say that a certain answer or plan is the best to get you parole. <br>
        What makes someone a better candidate for parole? <br>
        Do factors such as age, race, crime, time served, facility and county of commitment
        play a role in predicting parole interview outcomes?<br>
        With this project, I set out to find trends in parole outcomes using only publicly available
        data about parole interviews between September 2021 to September 2023.
